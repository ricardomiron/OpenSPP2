### 19.0.2.1.3

- fix(security): deactivate this module's default-credential demo users
  (created with the well-known password ``demo``) when installed on a database
  without demo data, so the known credentials cannot be used to log in on a
  production instance; the accounts stay active on demo/evaluation databases.
  Also lowers ``development_status`` from ``Production/Stable`` to ``Alpha`` so
  the demo module no longer signals production-readiness.

### 19.0.2.1.1

- fix(demo): name each farm after its head member and give every member the head's family name so a household reads as one family; farm names and registry IDs stay unique and generation remains seed-deterministic, resolving duplicate farm names and duplicate Tax/National IDs (#1114)
- fix(demo): resolve the head's gender once (up front) for blueprints with `head_gender="any"` and use it for both the head's name pool and the head member's gender, so a head's name always matches their recorded gender (no more e.g. a male-gendered head named "Maria") (#1114)

### 19.0.2.1.0

- feat(demo): add GIS + irrigation scenario (FM4) with reservoir + canal network seed; FM4's idle hectare is now narratively explained as the downstream consequence of reduced reservoir capacity
- feat(demo): seed farm assets (hand tractor on FM1, water pump on FM8) and a `manage_farm_asset` change request in the CR lifecycle
- feat(demo): add a closed prior-year farm season alongside the active one to demonstrate the `draft → active → closed` state machine
- chore(deps): declare `spp_gis`, `spp_land_record`, `spp_irrigation`, `spp_farmer_registry_vocabularies` explicitly — these were used at runtime but never listed
- docs(demo): add Scenario 10 (GIS + irrigation walk for FM4); document AGROVOC species selection (rice / tilapia) in Scenario 1; add farm-season state-machine sub-step; refresh FM1/FM4/FM8 farm story tables and the CR overview

### 19.0.2.0.0

- Initial migration to OpenSPP2
