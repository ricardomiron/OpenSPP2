"""Helpers for documenting polymorphic dict-typed request bodies.

A polymorphic body is a request field whose Python type stays `dict` (so
downstream code can keep calling `.get(...)`) but whose OpenAPI schema is
documented as a `oneOf` of typed Pydantic models.

Usage in a schema:

    from ..utils.openapi_polymorphic import polymorphic_body

    class ExecuteRequest(BaseModel):
        inputs: dict = polymorphic_body(
            SpatialStatisticsInputs,
            ProximityStatisticsInputs,
            description="Process input values; structure depends on process_id.",
        )

Wiring the hook (once per FastAPI app):

    from .utils.openapi_polymorphic import install_polymorphic_openapi_hook
    install_polymorphic_openapi_hook(app)

Why a hook is needed: models passed to `polymorphic_body` are referenced only
via `$ref` strings in `json_schema_extra`. FastAPI's OpenAPI generator does not
discover them from endpoint signatures, so the hook injects them into
`components/schemas` after generation.
