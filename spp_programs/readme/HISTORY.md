### 19.0.2.2.1

- fix(security): make the async operation lock a server-side boundary. The
  Force Unlock buttons were gated to `base.group_system` in the views, but
  `action_force_unlock` on `spp.cycle` / `spp.program` — and direct writes to
  the `is_locked` / `locked_reason` fields — had no server-side check, so any
  role holding write access (program officers, managers, cycle approvers)
  could clear an active operation lock via RPC while async entitlement /
  payment / eligibility jobs were still running. Direct writes to the lock
  fields now require `base.group_system` (via a `write()` guard), the manual
  `action_force_unlock` override requires the same, and the async pipeline
  manages the lock through `sudo()` helpers so legitimate acquire/release
  from the initiating user keeps working.

### 19.0.2.1.3

- fix(security): align Program Viewer / Validator / Cycle Approver roles with the OP#951 menu audit — Program Viewer additionally gets `group_registry_viewer` + `group_approval_viewer` (read-only Registry + Approvals access); all three program roles get `group_hazard_viewer` + `group_gis_report_user` so they retain Hazard / GIS Reports visibility once those menu roots are gated. Adds `spp_hazard` and `spp_gis_report` to module dependencies.
- fix(security): hide the Registry top-level menu for Global Program Cycle Approver per the OP#951 audit. Swap Tier-2 `spp_registry.group_registry_viewer` (which gates the Registry menu) for Tier-3 `spp_registry.group_registry_write` (ACL-only, no menu). `group_registry_write` transitively implies `group_registry_read`, so the role keeps read+write access to registrant data via Programs cross-references — only the dedicated top-level menu disappears.

### 19.0.2.1.2

- fix(security): add global `ir.rule` records on `spp.program.membership` and `spp.cycle.membership` that filter by `partner_id.area_id` against the user's `center_area_ids` (OP#989 round-2). The earlier Python `_prepare_domain` override on program memberships only caught `search_read` / `web_search_read` and missed counts (`search_count`, `read_group`), dropdowns (`name_search`), and related-field traversal — and cycle memberships had no filter at all. Both rules use a conditional domain that's a no-op for users with no center areas (global roles).

### 19.0.2.1.1

- fix(views): apply `spp_registry.x2many_no_padding` widget to the Programs and Entitlements lists on registrant forms and to Program Membership inline lines — removes the four empty placeholder rows Odoo 19 inserts on inline list-in-form views (#943).

### 19.0.2.0.11

- Fix `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` when clicking **Enroll Eligible** on programs with at least 200 beneficiaries (async dispatch path)
- Mirror `get_beneficiaries` semantics in `_enroll_eligible_registrants_async`: when `state` is `None`, omit the state filter instead of crashing on `tuple(None)`

### 19.0.2.0.10

- Increase parallel-safe channel limits (cycle, eligibility_manager, program_manager) from 1 to 4
- Add serial `entitlement_approval` channel (limit=1) for fund balance safety
- Add serial `statistics_refresh` channel (limit=1) to prevent concurrent refresh storms
- Add `identity_key` to async job dispatchers to prevent duplicate submission on double-click

### 19.0.2.0.9

- Add context flags (`skip_registrant_statistics`, `skip_program_statistics`) to suppress expensive computed field recomputation during bulk operations
- Add `refresh_beneficiary_counts()` on program and `refresh_statistics()` on cycle for one-shot recomputation after bulk operations
- Replace `bool(rec.program_membership_ids)` with SQL query in `_compute_has_members`

### 19.0.2.0.8

- Replace OFFSET pagination with NTILE-based ID-range batching in all async job dispatchers
- Add `compute_id_ranges()` utility using PostgreSQL NTILE window function
- Add `min_id`/`max_id` support to `get_beneficiaries()` on program and cycle

### 19.0.2.0.7

- Bulk membership creation using raw SQL INSERT ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING for program and cycle memberships
- Replace per-record ORM creates in `_import_registrants` and `_add_beneficiaries` with bulk SQL path

### 19.0.2.0.6

- Remove unused entitlement_base_model.py (dead code, never imported)
- Fix manifest summary to remove marketing language
- Recover 5 orphaned test files and add core model, wizard, manager, payment, and fund tests (172 → 492 tests)

### 19.0.2.0.5

- Batch create entitlements and payments instead of one-by-one ORM creates

### 19.0.2.0.4

- Fetch fund balance once per approval batch instead of per entitlement

### 19.0.2.0.3

- Replace cycle computed fields (total_amount, entitlements_count, approval flags) with SQL aggregation queries

### 19.0.2.0.2

- Add composite indexes for frequent query patterns on entitlements and program memberships

### 19.0.2.0.1

- Replace Python-level uniqueness checks with SQL UNIQUE constraints for program membership, cycle membership, and entitlement codes
- Add pre-migration script to deduplicate existing data before constraint creation

### 19.0.2.0.0

- Initial migration to OpenSPP2
